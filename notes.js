// Model Collection View
//
// Model variables have the first letter capitalized.  it is good to make it singular
//    var Song = Backbone.Model.extend({
//         initialize: function(){
//             console.log("A new song has been created");
//         }
//     });
//    it is a constructor function and you use the SET method to set attributes


// Collection variables have the first letter capitalized.  it is good to make them plural
//    var Songs = Backbone.Collection.extend({
//        model: Song
//    });

// collections are a list of models -- like tweets

views is not what you see -- it is the object that renders the content and changes
